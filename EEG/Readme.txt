code.py is the brute force file, it takes file location from test_spec matches the file name with the column named spectograph_id in the test.csv file and based on that present the correct output along with the bar graph on matplotlib.

m.py is the model file although the model is working but the accuracy is pretty low around 18-20%, so can't use that.
